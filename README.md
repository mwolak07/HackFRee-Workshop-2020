# HackFRee-Workshop-2020

Overview: This is the code and powerpoint for a student workshop aimed at introducing beginners to FPGA led at the 2020 HackFRee hackathon. 

Details:
- Extension of what was learned at my internship at MindChasers, Inc.
- The beginning of the presentation focused on introducing the concept of FPGA, showing how it is different than software development, and introducing some real-world uses.
- The second part of the presentation introduces the basics of Verilog HDL, emphasizing that it is not a programming language but a hardware description language.
- Includes some interactive practice examples for the concepts.
- Small FPGA development board allows students to test their Verilog and interact with it.
- The last part of the presentation focuses on more complicated examples, and shows a video of a cool application of Verilog HDL and FPGAs.
- Uses the FireAnt development board based on an Efinix Trion T8 FPGA.
